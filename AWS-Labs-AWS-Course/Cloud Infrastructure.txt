Cloud Infrastructure: 
---Globally distributed interconnected sets of independent data centers.

---Globally Distributed: 
                 100+ datacenters (AWS & Azure) are operational around the globe.

---Inter-Connected:
           Datacenters are connected through high speed, redundant network links
           forming a network backbone.

---Sets Of:
          Two or more datacenters are running as a backup.
          Datacenters works on pairs/sets as backup for each other
          Microsoft tries to ensures minimum 03 datacenters
          In busy regions number can be high up to 06 datacenters

---Independent Datacenters:
    ...Each datacenters operate autonomously.
    ...Equipped with its own resources, power supply, cooling systems and security measures.
    ...Power, networking and cooling infra is dedicated for each datacenter and it
       is not shared.

---On-demand delivery:
     ...Means cloud provider has the resources you need, when you need them
     
--- IT resources over the internet:
     ... Servers, networks, storage, development tools and application

--- Pay as you go pricing:
    ... pay only for what you need when you use it
